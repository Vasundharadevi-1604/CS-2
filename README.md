## 📖 Project Overview 

This project explores how Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming cybersecurity while introducing potential risks such as prompt injection, data leakage, and adversarial attacks. It implements the Lightweight LLM Security Evaluation and Mitigation Framework (LSEMF) - A Python-based system designed to detect, mitigate, and secure LLM interactions in cybersecurity applications.

## 🔒 Key Features

- Prompt Filtering Module:
Blocks malicious or unsafe inputs before they reach the LLM.

- Retrieval-Based Reinforcement Module:
Enhances model reliability using context retrieval from a verified knowledge base.

- LLM Query Module:
Ensures only validated prompts are processed and generates safe, relevant responses.

- Experimental Metrics Module:
Evaluates performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Injection Success Rate (ISR), and Response Utility.

## ⚙️ Methodology

To enhance the security of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining high model performance and usability.

Core Components:

- Prompt Filtering – Detects unsafe or adversarial prompts.

- Retrieval-Based Reinforcement – Verifies LLM outputs with trusted references using TF-IDF similarity.

- Evaluation Metrics – Quantitatively measures improvements in accuracy and attack resilience.

Expected Outcomes:

- 60% reduction in Injection Success Rate (ISR)

- +3% improvement in accuracy

- +4% increase in precision
